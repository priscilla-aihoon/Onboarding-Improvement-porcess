# KZA Employee Onboarding Process Enhancement

## Project Overview
This project documents my end-to-end Business Analysis work to modernize the employee onboarding process at KZA Logistics. The original onboarding flow was manual, fragmented, and dependent on emails and spreadsheets. I redesigned the experience using structured BA techniques — from use case modeling to workflow redesign — to move the organization toward a streamlined, digital onboarding process.

## Objectives
- Reduce onboarding delays and repetitive manual steps
- Improve communication across HR, IT, Payroll, Operations, Procurement & Mailroom
- Standardize application, screening, offer, and onboarding flows
- Automate notifications, approvals, and cross-department handoffs
- Provide clear documentation for future system development
